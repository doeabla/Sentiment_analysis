# Sentiment Analysis of COVID Vaccination Tweets with Hugging Face Transformers
## Overview
This sentiment analysis project leverages state-of-the-art language models, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT, for sentiment classification on tweets related to COVID-19 vaccination. The models are fine-tuned on a labeled dataset, and a Gradio app is developed to provide an interactive interface for sentiment analysis.

## Features
* RoBERTa, BERT, DistilBERT Models: Utilizes powerful pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT.
* Training Data: The models are trained on a dataset containing tweets specifically related to COVID-19 vaccination sentiments.
* Gradio App: An interactive Gradio app is developed to allow users to input text and obtain sentiment predictions using the RoBERTa model.
* Hugging Face Integration: Leverages Hugging Face's Model Hub for easy access to pre-trained language models, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT.
